# HandDetectionBasics
This module leverages OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track hands in real-time using a webcam. It processes video frames to identify hand landmarks and returns their coordinates for further use. The module can draw hand connections on the video feed for visualization.

How to Use:
1 -> Clone the repository.
2 -> Install dependencies:
  -- pip install opencv-python mediapipe
3 -> Run the example script:
  -- python projectExample.py
  
  
This module can be easily integrated into gesture control or interactiveÂ applications.
